# Build Classifier Model to predict 'Income'.
Project Objective
1. Perform EDA and FE and store the cleaned data to "MongoDB".

2. Build a Classifier Model that will be able to predict "Income" using each of following Algorithms:

1.1) Logistic Regression Algorithm

1.2) SVC

3. Have to perform Hyperparameter tuning using "Grid search CV"

4. Evaluate the performance of the Model using confusion matrix, ROC AUC score
